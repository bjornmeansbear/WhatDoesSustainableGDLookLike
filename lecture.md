# What does sustainable graphic design look like?
(I wish I knew)

This is a question that has no real answer; but I have many avenues of exploration whcih attempt to provide answers... bear with me.

I'm trying to think about this from the frame of "what do you want to sustain" and then how your professional practice actually helps do that/visualize that...

## Beginnings.

In 2006 I found myself working with a group of activists, web developers and entrepeneurs. We wanted to make and sell biodiesel, convert old disesel to run on waste vegetable oil, educate the public about weening off fossil fuels. It turned out that many of the people and orgs we partnered with to promote biodiesel and bicycling and the like were in need of web and communication design services. So we also built websites and started working on print graphics and identities and the like. 

The first real print project I did where print process and paper selection were able to be "sustainably" focused was the Minneapolis Green Roof guide. The minneapolis green roof group contained some members that bought biodiesel from us, so we started talking to them about a website that could provide a map of all the greenroofs and then data about each project. 

After starting to work on that, it turned out that an important conference was happening in the twin cities, and so they wanted a print guide to go with it. It meant that we had to find a printer that used soy inks, and that would help us order the best possible paper stock at the time... we found a smaller printer about an hour south of Minneapolis, and then ended up driving down to do the pickup ourselves for 1) speed, and 2) to make sure the footprint of delivery was minimized -- we used a biodiesel VW to do the pickup and deliveries.

[Images of guide? Images of website?]

So, we did other similar projects, but mainly we were working on websites. So I won't get too much into this, that one in particular felt like a real first step in my graphic designing + sustainabilitizing practice.

We were also sharing a studio with a photographer that had some giant epson printers, which weren't super common at the time, so we were designing posters we thought people might be into promoting our various ideas and offerings. The one's I designed specifically as "green" or "sustainable" ones I still look back on with naive enjkoyment... (not quite the right words)

- ![The Other Side Does Not Have To Be Greener](https://jubilee-live.flickr.com/1135/764323867_12a1df2455_o.jpg)

So, That's where I started with my "sustainable designing" -- it was 2006 and 2007 and I was 1. using my visual form giving skills to try and make messages more "beautiful" and "digestable"; and 2. doing process/paper research to pick the "least bad" options for physical object output.

This was more or less in alignment with "best practices" of Graphic Designing -- you pick the right materials, and otherwise, everything stays the same.

[MICA]

## Grad School

At some point, that started to frustrate me; and I thought that maybe a graduate school experience would let me explore this in more ways. I ended up here at MICA, and while the program itself didn't have a focus on sustainability it was focused on the idea that a designer might do more than merely put a superficial gloss on other people's content... 

![Urban Forest Project?](http://kristian.bjornard.com/sites/kristian.bjornard.com/files/imagecache/portfolio-work-giant/designwork/print/main/Poster-eatexcrete1.jpg)

I did a lot of different kinds of work -- web, print, more conceptual exercises.

- That C2C poster too?

A lot of my work dealt with systems, with using simple programming to help generate or sketch solutions, to reducing inputs but maximizing outputs... And then other things directly dealt with sustainability. At first these things stayed in the superficial category -- either directly being about visualizing sustainability concepts

I kept a blog for a while trying to document ideas and things I'd found and tried

![Better living with sustainability: a website/blog?](http://www.thesustainabilitist.com/img/visuals/4857362271_40e9f1ffb6_b.jpg)

I also tried really simplifying my explanation for how to understand sustainability.

- ![Understanding Sustainability: Actions](http://www.thesustainabilitist.com/img/visuals/understandingsust-action.jpg)
- ![Understanding Sustainability: Philosophy](http://www.thesustainabilitist.com/img/visuals/understandingsust-philosophy.jpg)

Or experimenting with how to make visuals that somehow through their aesthetics were "more sustainable." For instance, is there someway to determine what the "greenest" -- meaning most signifying of environmentalist intent -- color is?

![The Greenest Green v1.0](https://jubilee-live.flickr.com/4076/4761478042_41e69d26ee_o.jpg)

![The Greenest green v2.0](http://www.thesustainabilitist.com/img/visuals/greenestgreen.jpg)

How do I visualize all these things in new icons now using that color? using a limited toolkit of materials?

![Sustainable Icon Set](http://www.thesustainabilitist.com/img/sustkop.png)

What else signals these ideas?

![Better Living Through Sustainability](https://jubilee-live.flickr.com/4073/4761476396_667d483701_o.jpg)

![Building a better future](https://jubilee-live.flickr.com/4078/4761476146_841d75e73a_o.jpg)

And via those projects I came to actually phrase the question: what does sustainable deisgn look like?

## What does sustainable graphic design look like?

![what does SGD look like #1](http://www.thesustainabilitist.com/img/visuals/whatdoessustgdlooklike.jpg)

![What Does SGD look like?](https://jubilee-live.flickr.com/2789/4426654518_43caa7cd48_o.jpg)

Posing this question to myself, I came up with sort of 4 main answers:
1. It looks "eco friendly"  
   meaning that it fully embraces its environmentalist connections and you don't hide whatever material or process restrictions are required for maximum eco/society friendliness
![SGD looks ecofriendly](https://jubilee-live.flickr.com/2709/4433647723_e1f5e5d1d0_o.jpg)

2. It looks the same  
   meaning that aesthetics aren't really important, its just that you make it with the right materials and the right ideals.
![SGD looks the same](https://jubilee-live.flickr.com/4035/4434422776_57236c963c_o.jpg)

3. It looks innovative/progressive/futuristic  
   these ideas are about changing everything and looking to a utopian future; the designs aesthetics should somehow reflect the innovative nature of the work.
![SGD looks innovative](https://jubilee-live.flickr.com/4064/4434425136_9abc14cc3c_o.jpg)

4. It does not exist.  
   meaning initially that there really just isn't such a thing as sustainable designing â€¦ and that this was a futile exercise
![SGD does not exist](https://jubilee-live.flickr.com/4058/4436521303_90754d3410_o.jpg)

So, I had made work that attempted to live in these first three areas. for sure.

[cardboard table?]

But that 4th option stuck with me. Sustainable Graphic Design does not exist. What if instead of seeing this as a negative, a hopeless sort of view, I instead took it as a prompt? a conceptual challenge?

So instead I started thinking about "sustainable graphic design does not exist" more as a call to action -- how can we bring things together to have them communicate a specific message; but then have all the parts go back to whatever they were before???

[Zine images]

I first tried using some old zines we had made way to many of as substrate for new work -- as a way into this idea.

And then I arrived on this other idea...

I had been trying to visualize the interconnections between the books and essays and such I had been using in my research. Upon presenting this in critiques I was told that it was boring and sort of intellectually interesting but not useful or visually worthwhile. Not willing to let it go, I decided to prove the critic wrong and kept working on how to make the idea useful.

This led me to do more writing and more cataloging and organzing of the objects of my research...

I ended up writing this sort of manifesto; and through refining my ideas down to a handful of, well, what was trying to be precise aphorisms, started thinking about what had inspired these ideas/ideals. So I was then thinking, well here are principles, and here are the books they came from... that idea through a few iterations and with the lens of "if design should not exist, then design should have no footprint" led me to making an installation instead of a book or a poster or whatever... so, that was this...

[Sustainabilitist Principles]

And, I really felt like I had something finally. This one piece was a real culmination of all my ideas and thinking into one peice that came together for this exhibition... and then just went back to its consituent parts afterward. Hurray.

I did manage to make a business card that utilized this thinking as well:

![Business card](http://kristian.bjornard.com/sites/kristian.bjornard.com/files/imagecache/portfolio-work-giant/designwork/identity/main/Stamped_cards.jpg)

I would stamp my info over someone elses...

And this website did come out of that... http://www.thesustainabilitist.com

## Next steps?

I get to the end of grad school, high on my ingenous success... and then, fuck, I don't have any outlets for these ideas anymore -- I mean, I go back to doing client projects like magazine and websites. And while I keep trying to make them materially better, or offset their energy with renewable energy, or utilize free cultural resources so as much is reuseable as possible, it just isn't enough. 

Oh man, this was a bummer. I thought I had figured it all out. But then, I couldn't really utilize this "design is dematerialized" idealism for much...

So I turned back to the "sustainable design is the same" kind of stuff...

[2010 design-a-days?]

I made a lot of posters, and a lot of superficial one offs. At first it was just to try to continue exploring some of the ideas even in a small way... but I realized that maybe I could find other ways to make design not exist.

So, I'm making all these things and I realize -- I'm creating my own design vernacular; I can use these to test design aesthetics, and hone a set of processes and formats and fonts and colors and image references that I can forever reuse and return to.

It became sort of an exercise in Entropy -- if there is limited energy (and limited time, etc.); how can I get better at rapidly producing things? what can I figure out that I know works well enough and thus not have to change it unless there is a real reason.

This fit into some ideas from my principles after all... Durability? Entropy? Systems? Slowness? Agility? Constraint? Brand's Vernacular?

And then I did reuse some of these ideas, something becomes a future book cover, something becomes a future ad for something else, something becomes a layout in a magazine, an image gets reused...

[OOKB design patterns?]
![Type, Colors, Images](https://jubilee-live.flickr.com/8701/16966461297_fdc6d1a163_o.jpg)

I even end up turning these ideas into class projects; all the presentations I've done in the last 8 years have used the same base templates and folder of images...

This what does SGD look like question changes again; so maybe by not existing it also means that new energy isn't wasted unnecessarily when an old or existing solution is already waiting for you to be reused/recycled -- we can do that with ideas, not just materials. And we can do it with our own work.

![LayerCake of Sustainability?](https://jubilee-live.flickr.com/4024/4444250413_6e031cf777_o.jpg)

It did connect me with some interesting people, like Architecture for Humanity...

## Urbanite

As a sidenote, I did end up working with a pretty cool Baltimore magazine for a while. As the designer at the urbanite; which focused on stories of import to Baltimore city -- political stories; social stories; environmental stories -- I felt like graphic designing that magazine, even if it didn't look particualrly special or different or innovative was sustainable; it was helping sustain ideas that hoped to improve racial, social, urban, and environmental situations in our area. That felt right. It seemed like a way that my designing visualized what I wanted to sustainâ€¦ even if it did "look the same" and the materials weren't better.

## Green Acres?
I also found myself working with an art museum; the contemporary museum. At the time they had a brand new curator that was all about doing things with as few resources as possible. (partially because she wanted to maximize what they could do; but also cause they were mostly broke).

This led to a lot of inventive solutions design wise... But Sue's interest has been eco-art for a long time. So I also got to work on a lot of catalogs and such that were about environmental art work -- art and artists dealing with social and einvironmental issues. 

And then there was this cool show that was about artists using farming as their main practice. Green Acres.

![Green Acres Cover & Stack](https://www.ookb.co/img/ex/greenacres.jpg)

For the book I really thought about 1. how could the design of this be about farming? and 2. what's the best way we can make it? So the page layout tried to reference the idea of commericial farming -- broken into these perfect squares; the type would end in perfect columns creating weird spaces that would then get decorated with farming graphics; sort of how land doesn't quite get used perfectly in commercial endevaros cause irrigation can't happen or its too strange a shape for a big combine to drive over/around... anyway, I was intending it to be kind of a counterpoint to the content, but still derived from "nature" in an interesting way...

And then we printed the book on demand -- so only the amount you need gets printed; and its easy to print more. The printer was into helping make it as "sustainable" as possible, so its got vegetable wax laser toner and high recycled content paper...

But it was back to being "the same" graphic design mostly; but content wise, it really felt like I was using design to sustain what I believed in

## Re-runs
In the spirit of recycling and whatever else... I go back to this design-a-day thing a couple years later.

https://www.flickr.com/photos/bjornmeansbear/albums/72157649677648318

This time, its more about using graphic designing to really help explain what I'm struggling with. This becomes some mini design essays that play out in spreads/screens/slides instead of written pages. A design comic book almost? its also trying to show this evolution, new ideas or explanations overlay the previous to show how a slide gets to be what/where it is...

Is this sustainable graphic design? its using all my pre-defined styles and font choices and imagery and the like... 

At this point I also start teaching full time. My practice drops off. I'm still doing the occasional identity or magazine or whatever, but I start getting way more serious about asking clients if they're into the things I say I'm into -- environmentally positive solutions; not just less bad. Can we not do the project they are asking about and find some more immaterial solution? Do you really need to re-brand your institution/company??? I find that I don't often win proposals anymore... 

## Ecovention Europe?

This reuse thing really coallesces when Sue asks me to do another book with her

## Free/Libre Open Source

## What else???

## A Conclusion?

So, here I am now, stuck in this position where I teach designers to design; but sort of don't think its okay to make stuff in most of the ways designers have traditionally made stuff and for the clients designers traditionally would have been hired by. I guess my new realization; my new way of trying to use design in the way that it sustains what I believe is that design is like writing? everyone should learn about designing; its a way of communicating, a way of describing our thoughts to others. It should be turned onto every situation -- every human situation is a communication moment; so everyone could be improved with design?

I'm also sort of thinking that the things I want to sustain are hard to do with just a poster or a visual aesthetic. And infact a singular aesthetic is sort of the antithesis of design that respects all cultures; all people; all objects; all animals; all plants. Those are things with diverse aesthetics and needs and materials; they can't all be served with one overarching formal set of solutions (at least not exactly). Again, maybe returning to language is good -- english as a language is capable of describing a lot of different view points and sub cultures. Some of the rules for use stay the same; but some change drastically based on location, class, etc. A sustainable design should too. And it should be able to evolve and adapt as things change -- time, space, place. 

It also has to be a design that doesn't priveledge whiteness; euro-centricness; etc. And again that means that it can't just look the same as previous designs... even in the measure of eco-friendliness or innovative ness, those judgements I made in the past were from my white, euro, male centric place... were even my ideas of dematerilization??? fuck,

So, I guess I both more and less am sure about what SGD is?

the end????

## To get to somehow:

What signs on substrates are "sustainable" and which aren't? Does it matter about the signs the substrates themselves? is it design that supports/communicates "sustainability" regardless?

Something like a first things first manifesto; but for climate change related ethics... something like the Gropius bauhaus manifesto, but for respectful design principles?

John Ehrenfeld states in the book Flourishing that "the key to do something about sustainability is that you first have to say what it is you want to sustain." To define sustainable graphic design we must first define what it is we are sustaining. Ehrenfeld wants to sustain that "all humans and other life should flourish." (Pg 23 in flourishing). Using Ehrenfeld's thinking, Sustainable graphic design is then design made for clients that believe all life should flourish; design made to promote messages about sustainability-as-flourishing; and design made with materials and processes that promote and sustain the state of all life flourishing too.

Bruce Mau phrases this similarly in his writings around the Massive Change project: Our project is the welfare of all life as a practical objective.

SGD is graphic design in support of all life flourishing... Sustainable design is then not just one fixed thing; all things flourishing might need to take a lot of forms; adapt to a lot of different kinds of situations...

The welfare of all life is not a traditional goal of business, culture, and design in our current milieu.

[Slides from my various design essay days???]

Sustainable design's form must declare that "humans and all life should flourish." How might an aesthetic or form convey this message? What aesthetic or form conveys this message? Are there visual choices that are more sustainable?

To call a work of design beautiful is to recognize it as a rendition of values critical to our flourishing. A transubstantiation of our individual ideals in material medium.
-- Alain de Botton, Architecture of Happiness

AdB provides some insights for how we might integrate sustainability & design: if beauty in design embodies one's values then non-sustainable design would be non-beautiful design -- any design not looking out for the welfare of all life is bad, ugly design. Only design that inspires sustainable ideals counts as beautiful.

Sustainable design: Beautiful things; Sentimental things; Utilitarian things... (there are those categories of things; and then there is everything else. Everything else need not exist). Sustainable design needs to be the "prettiest" stuff; the most meaningful stuff; and the most functional stuff -- preferably all of the above. BUT! beauty; meaning; these are subject to context (beauty is in the eye of the beholder after all?) -- does the context of "the welfare of all life" help people see things the same way? -- does this mean that there is no singular "sustainable" design solution?

Nature does not typically solve design problems with singular solutions. There are usually many overlapping and resilient ways things work out in or world's ecosystems. So: sustainability may then have many definitions; sustainable design might provide many styles, aesthetics, processes, and methods...

Design has helped to change and shape the world (for better or for worse) in gigantic, important ways. Whatever happens next, the world will not be like it is today -- either because we do something to make it better for the welfare of all life; or because we just keep on keeping on as is and destroy all life.
